# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Tools: Nikto & Hping3

## 🔍 Introduction

This project explores two important cybersecurity tools — **Nikto** and **Hping3** — used to find and prevent security weaknesses in systems and networks.

* **Nikto** scans web servers to detect outdated software, misconfigurations, and common web vulnerabilities like **XSS** and **SQL Injection**.
* **Hping3** tests networks and firewalls by sending custom packets. It helps simulate real attacks such as **port scanning** and **DoS attacks** to check how systems respond.

Both tools are essential for understanding system vulnerabilities and improving security defenses.

## 🧩 Countermeasures

### 🔸 Nikto

* Keep the web server **updated and patched**
* Add security headers (`X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`)
* Disable **directory listing** and limit **HTTP methods**
* Remove unused modules and files

### 🔸 Hping3

* **Configure firewalls** to allow only needed ports
* Use **IDS/IPS systems** to detect abnormal traffic
* Apply **anti-DDoS protections** to handle large attacks

## 📘 Conclusion

**Nikto** and **Hping3** help identify weaknesses before attackers do.
They allow professionals to test, analyze, and strengthen both web and network security effectively.
